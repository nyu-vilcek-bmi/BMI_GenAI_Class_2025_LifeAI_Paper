Short Version (Processing Instructions)

The short SAD reproducibility package and all materials can be accessed using this shared Google Drive Folder. Please only utilize the files present in “Analysis- Concise Version” for this analysis.

Purpose: Quick verification of Dataset 4 preprocessing.

Scope: Runs Dataset 3 through clustering, length filtering, and non-redundant processing.

Outputs: Three files (dataset4_length_filtered.csv, dataset4_nonredundant_final.csv, dataset4_redundancy_analysis.csv).

Recommended if you only need to confirm that our processed dataset matches the description in the manuscript.

Long Version (README START HERE)

The comprehensive SAD reproducibility package and all materials can be accessed using this shared Google Drive Folder. For this version, please utilize all files/folders in “Analysis- Extended Version” (starting with the README file).

Purpose: Full reproducibility pathway for all four datasets.

Scope: Includes step-by-step guidance for clustering, filtering, SAD analysis, statistical modeling, and output verification.

Options:

Option A: Full verification (recreate Dataset 4 from scratch).

Option B: Quick-Start Bundle (recommended; one download with all files/scripts pre-organized).

Option C: Browse results only (no coding required).

Recommended if you want to fully reproduce the pipeline and confirm all analysis stages.
In short: use the Processing Instructions for a concise dataset check, or the README for a full step-by-step reproducibility test.
